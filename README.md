**To-do List Manager**
I'm thrilled to announce that I've just completed my To-do List Manager project using React JS! ğŸš€ğŸ“‹ Here's a quick overview of what I accomplished and the key React features I utilized:

**Features**
ğŸ”¹ Task Management: Easily add, edit, and delete tasks with specific categories to keep everything organized and efficient.

ğŸ”¹ State Management: Leveraging React's useState and useEffect hooks, I manage the state of the application efficiently. This includes tracking tasks, handling task completion, and filtering tasks by category.

ğŸ”¹ Local Storage: Using local storage to persist tasks, ensuring your to-do list is saved and available even after refreshing the page.

ğŸ”¹ Component-Based Architecture: The app is divided into reusable components (TaskForm, Task, and the main App component), making the code modular and easier to maintain.

ğŸ”¹ Conditional Rendering: Based on the state, I dynamically render task components and handle user interactions smoothly, ensuring a seamless user experience.

ğŸ”¹ Category Filtering: Implemented a category filter to easily view tasks by their categories, making it simple to focus on specific types of tasks.

ğŸ”¹ Responsive UI: Ensured the app looks great on all devices with a clean and user-friendly design.

**Technologies Used**
React JS: For building the user interface.
CSS: For styling the components.
Local Storage: For persisting tasks between sessions.
